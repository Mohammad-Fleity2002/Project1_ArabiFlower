# Continuous Delivery for a Simple Web Application

This project outlines the steps to set up a CI/CD pipeline that automates the process from code commit to deployment for a simple web application.

## Tasks

### 1. Setup a Cloud Provider Account
- Create an account on any cloud provider of your choice.

### 2. Version Control
a. Create a GitHub repository for the sample web application.  
b. Clone the repository to your local development environment.  
c. Create a basic web application (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and add it to the repository.  
d. Commit and push the code to the GitHub repository.  

### 3. Continuous Integration (CI)
a. Set up a CI/CD service.  
b. Configure CI to trigger builds automatically upon code commits.  
c. Create a CI pipeline that:
   1. Builds the web application.
   2. Runs automated tests (e.g., unit tests or integration tests).
   3. Generates a Docker image for the web application.

### 4. Containerization
a. Write a Dockerfile to containerize the web application.  
b. Push the Docker image to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub).  

### 5. Continuous Deployment (CD)
